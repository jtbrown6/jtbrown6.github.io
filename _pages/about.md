# About Me

I'm a DMV Native Cloud Engineer and Founder of [GovCloud Solutions, LLC](https://www.govcloudsolutions.io) who's goal is to support our Federal Government and DoD Agencies with Cloud Adoption. I apply the DevSecOps Fundamentals to Cloud Native Projects and Workloads with an emphasis on Modernizing Applications to be Containerized and ready to Kubernetes Adoption.

After earning my BS Degree in Computer Science from Lincoln University (PA) and my MS Degree from Towson University in Applied Information Technology, 
I began supporting Defense Agencies in numerous roles around Software Engineering, Cyber Security and Cloud Engineering. After roughly 8 years in Defense, 
my career shifted into Big Tech supporting [Microsoft's FastTrack for Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/azure/partners/fasttrack-for-azure) 
Program where I supported the Cloud and AI Division as a Kubernetes Engineer.
